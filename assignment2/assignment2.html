      House plants do more than simply make your home look better. These plants
      can help make your home healthier and better for you to live in by
      improving the air quality. Research done by NASA has proven the benefits
      of certain house plants, and you need to consider getting these plants for
      your home.

    <img  src="./image/Dracaena.gif" alt="image" />
    <p>
      Dracaena is a long striped plant that can easily thrive in your home. This
      is due to the fact that it only needs small amounts of sun and moderate
      watering. However, this plant is able to offer a range of benefits that
      you need for your home. The plant is able to eliminate trichloroethylene
      which comes from varnish and solvents. These chemicals are also found in
      printing inks and adhesives. When this is present in your home it can
      cause headaches, dizziness, vomiting, and drowsiness which could lead to a
      coma with long-term exposure.

    <p>
      One of the most visually appealing plants is the Peace Lily with its
      unique white flowers. This plant also has the highest transpiration rate
      of all the plants on this list. However, it is important that these plants
      can be toxic so keep it out of reach of pets and children. The Peace Lily
      is able to remove trichloroethylene, alcohols, acetone, and benzene from
      the air. Short-term exposure to benzene has been linked to increased heart
      rates, headaches, and irritation of the eyes. Long-term exposure to this
      chemical can result in unconsciousness.

    <p>
      The Snake Plant is unique in the fact that it is one of the few plants
      that turn carbon dioxide into oxygen during the night. While this is a
      good thing for your home, it is not the only benefit that the Snake Plant
      is able to offer. These plants are best placed in the bedroom and a
      carpeted living room. The reason for this is the fact that the plant is
      able to prevent formaldehyde leaks from the wood furniture and carpets.
      The plant will remove this chemical from the air which will ensure that
      your lungs are healthy. The placement in the bedroom will also help you
      have a better nightâ€™s sleep

    <p>
      If you have trouble keeping plants alive, then you will love the Golden
      Pothos. This plant is quite hard to kill and the vines will grow fairly
      quickly. This makes it a great hanging plant or one that is placed on an
      elevated surface. This is considered to be one of the best starter plants
      for people who have never had to look after indoor plants before. Like the
      Snake Plant, the Golden Pothos is able to remove formaldehyde from the
      air. This plant will also double up as an effective carbon monoxide
      remover. This is important because carbon monoxide can be deadly if not
      taken care of.

    <p>
      The Dragon Tree is one of the plants that are very popular in office
      spaces and homes because of the attractive look. You can pot a number of
      these plants together and train them to grow into a braid for additional
      appeal. This plant also has amazing purifying powers. However, you will
      need to be careful with this plant if you have cats and dogs because it
      can be toxic to them if they eat it. The Dragon Tree is able to pull
      xylene from the air. This is a chemical which is released by cigarettes,
      car exhausts, and paints. Short-term exposure to this chemical can cause
      irritation in the throat, heart problems, kidney damage, and confusion.
